README

This OSF repository contains several files relevant to the PROMT (Phonetic Recalibration Of Multiple Talkers) project. 

— PROMT.RProj: An RProject file for this study. This plays nicely with the “here” package and makes it such that the user does not need to change the path of the working directory. Open this to launch your R session.

— PROMT_Analyses.R: The R script used for this study. Load this script once you have opened the R Project file.

— PROMT.Results.2020.09.18.RData: The environment file for the R project once the full script has been run. You can use this to quickly load the results of the R script.

— promt_demographics.csv: The demographics file that gets read into the R script. The R script will subset this to only be the participants who were included in analyses (i.e., those who passed the headphone screening, met data quality checks, etc.).

— Data folders (of the form “PROMT_ExpX_Data”), where X indicates the experiment number: These folders contain the raw output files from Gorilla. “Questionnaire” subfolders include demographic information (e.g., race/ethnicity, dialect).

— promt.results.plots.png: The results plot generated by the R Script.

— The “stimuli” folder contains .mp3 versions of all stimuli used for this experiment, as well as .png images for the “sign” and “shine” response prompts.
