From LMM21:
"Finally, to generate a set of male-spoken tokens, the finalized female tokens were passed through the “Change Gender” tool in Praat (Boersma & Weenik, 2017). Transformation parameters included setting the formant shift ratio to 0.8 and the new pitch median to 100 Hz. All other parameters were held at default values."
